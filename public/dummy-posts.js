      "See how easy it is to create a little tree right in your world. We artists are a different breed of people. We're a happy bunch. Talk to trees, look at the birds. Whatever it takes. Get away from those little Christmas tree things we used to make in school. Nice little clouds playing around in the sky. I'm gonna start with a little Alizarin crimson and a touch of Prussian blue I'm a water fanatic. I love water. That's what makes life fun. That you can make these decisions. That you can create the world that you want. Look at them little rascals. There we are. Let's give him a friend too. Everybody needs a friend. Give him a friend, we forget the trees get lonely too. Even trees need a friend. We all need friends. A tree needs to be your friend if you're going to paint him. Maybe there's a little something happening right here. We're not trying to teach you a thing to copy. We're just here to teach you a technique, then let you loose into the world. I'll go over the colors one more time that we use: Titanium white, Thalo green, Prussian blue, Van Dyke brown, Alizarin crimson, Sap green, Cad yellow, and Permanent red. Fluff that up. Let's make a happy little mountain now.",
